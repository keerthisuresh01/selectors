        <h2>THE SUN</h2>
        <div>The sun is a huge ball of gases. It has a diameter of 1,392,000 km. <br>
             It is so huge that it can hold millions of planets inside it. <br>
              The Sun is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium gas. <br>
               The surface of the Sun is known as the photosphere.  <br>
               The photosphere is surrounded by a thin layer of gas known as the chromospheres. <br>
                Without the Sun, there would be no life on Earth. There would be no plants, no animals and no human beings. <br>
                 As, all the living things on Earth get their energy from the Sun for their survival.</div> <br>
